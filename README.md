# Digital Biome for ROS/RTOS Integration in Bipedal Robot

## Overview
This project implements a digital biome for a bipedal robot, creating an adaptive and interactive environment for robotic systems. The digital biome incorporates neural networks for decision-making, genetic algorithms for evolutionary processes, sensor data processing, and a simulation environment.

## Project Structure

### Python Scripts

#### 1. `neural_network.py`
   - **Purpose**: Implements a neural network model used for decision-making based on processed sensor data.
   - **Usage**: Used by individuals within the digital biome to make decisions based on their sensor inputs.

#### 2. `sensor_data.py`
   - **Purpose**: Handles the acquisition and processing of sensor data.
   - **Usage**: Provides simulated sensor data to the individuals, emulating the input from the environment.

#### 3. `individual.py`
   - **Purpose**: Defines the `Individual` class, representing entities within the digital biome.
   - **Usage**: Individuals are the entities that interact with the bipedal robot, make decisions, and evolve over time.

#### 4. `simulator.py`
   - **Purpose**: Implements the simulation environment and evolutionary processes.
   - **Usage**: Manages the lifecycle of individuals and facilitates the evolutionary processes within the digital biome.

#### 5. `genome.py`
   - **Purpose**: Manages the genetic information and algorithms for the individuals.
   - **Usage**: Provides the genetic foundation for the individuals, influencing their behavior and characteristics.

#### 6. `bipedal_robot.py`
   - **Purpose**: Represents the bipedal robot and its interactions with the digital biome.
   - **Usage**: Serves as the bipedal robot within the simulation, interacting with the individuals and adapting its behavior based on the digital biome.

#### 7. `evolution.py` (Optional)
   - **Purpose**: (Description based on the content of the script)
   - **Usage**: (Description based on how the script is used in the project)
